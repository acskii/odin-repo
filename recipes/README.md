## What is this?
This is the first project that was given in TOP Foundations Course. **A Recipe Library**!

## Usage
At the moment, this doesn't have much value or functionality, but in the future, I might \
add some interactivity.

Currently, this will serve as a momento to remember the first step!

## Installation
If, for some reason, you want to have this project. Here are the instructions:

- Navigate to your desired directory,
- From the terminal, type
```
$ git clone git@github.com:acskii/odin-repo.git
```
- If you don't want my other projects here, then delete them after they are cloned..
    - Will try to find another way to do so soon!
- Done!
